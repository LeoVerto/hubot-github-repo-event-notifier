# Hubot: hubot-github-repo-event-notifier

Notifies about any available GitHub repo event via webhook.

See [`src/github-repo-event-notifier.coffee`](src/github-repo-event-notifier.coffee) for full documentation.

## Installation

Add **hubot-github-repo-event-notifier** to your `package.json` file:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "hubot": ">= 2.5.1",
  "hubot-scripts": ">= 2.4.2",
  "hubot-github-repo-event-notifier": ">= 0.0.0",
  "hubot-hipchat": "~2.5.1-5",
}
```

Add **hubot-github-repo-event-notifier** to your `external-scripts.json`:

```json
["hubot-github-repo-event-notifier"]
```

Run `npm install`

With a deployed hubot, configure each repository to webhook to [hubot_url_and_port]/hubot/gh-repo-events.  You will also need to set an environment variable `HUBOT_GITHUB_EVENT_NOTIFIER_TYPES` which can contain a comma-separated list (NB: without spaces!) of the events you'd like to subscribe to.  The list of options is here: http://developer.github.com/webhooks/#events

With the IRC adapter, you can also enable colors by setting the HUBOT_GITHUB_EVENT_NOTIFIER_IRC_COLORS environment variable.

## Development Testing

Ideally, you'd write tests and put them in our `test/` directory.

If you just want to mess around with some things, we've bundled a REPL for
you which has some fixture data and exposes the core functionality of the
processing of events. To boot up the reply, launch `script/console`.

* Sample payloads are available via the variable `eventPayloads`. It
  contains a key for each event type, e.g. `pull_request` or `page_build`.
* Each processing function is available via `actions`. This object contains
  a key for each event type, e.g. `pull_request` or `page_build`. It takes
  the payload object and the callback function as its parameters, in that
  order.

When testing webhooks, consider adding an additional IRC room to the list of rooms and then adding the additional parameter to your webhook, something like `?room=%23my-test-room` - this way you can deploy your bot but have it only make noise in a specific room.  I do this with a webhook on a test repository to work through the use cases.
